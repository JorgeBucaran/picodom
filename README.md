# Superfine [![npm](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/superfine.svg?label=&color=0080FF)](https://github.com/jorgebucaran/superfine/releases/latest)

Superfine is a minimal view layer for building web interfaces. Think Hyperapp without the frameworkâ€”no state management, effects, or subscriptionsâ€”just the absolute bare minimum. Mix it with your own custom-flavored state management solution, or use it standalone for maximum flexibility.

Is anything wrong, unclear, missing? Help us [improve this page](https://github.com/jorgebucaran/hyperapp/fork)!

## Quickstart

Install Superfine with npm or Yarn:

```console
npm i superfine
```

Then with a module bundler like [Parcel](https://parceljs.org) or [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org), import what you need and start using it in your project.

```js
import { h, text, patch } from "superfine"
```

Fear the build step? Import it in a `<script>` tag as a module. Don't worry; modules are supported in all evergreen, self-updating desktop, and mobile browsers.

```html
<script type="module">
  import { h, text, patch } from "https://unpkg.com/superfine"
</script>
```

How about we start with something simple: let's create a counter that can go up or down. You can copy and paste the following code in a new HTML file or go ahead and [try it here](https://cdpn.io/LdLJXX).

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <script type="module">
      import { h, text, patch } from "https://unpkg.com/superfine"

      const node = document.getElementById("app")

      const update = (state) => {
        patch(
          node,
          h("main", {}, [
            h("h1", {}, text(state)),
            h("button", { onclick: () => update(state - 1) }, text("-")),
            h("button", { onclick: () => update(state + 1) }, text("+")),
          ])
        )
      }

      update(0) // Here we go!
    </script>
  </head>
  <body>
    <main id="app"></main>
  </body>
</html>
```

We use the hyperscript function `h` to describe our view as a tree of nodes along with `text` for text nodes. The view isn't made out of real DOM nodes, but a virtual DOM: a representation of how the DOM should look using a plain object.

To update the real DOM so it matches our view, we use the `patch` function. By comparing the old and specified new virtual DOM we can touch only the parts of the DOM that changed instead of rendering the entire document from scratch! ðŸ™Œ

Here's a more interesting example. We're going to recycle our previous `setState` approach, but show you how to syncronize an element to a text field: [try it here](https://cdpn.io/KoqxGW).

```html
<script type="module">
  import { h, text, patch } from "https://unpkg.com/superfine"

  const node = document.getElementById("app")

  const setState = (state) => {
    patch(
      node,
      h("main", {}, [
        h("h1", {}, text(state)),
        h("input", {
          type: "text",
          value: state,
          oninput: (e) => setState(e.target.value),
          autofocus: true,
        }),
      ])
    )
  }

  setState("Hello!")
</script>
```

Spend some time thinking about how the view reacts to changes in the state. But rather than anonymous state updates, how about sending messages to a central store a-la Elm/Redux? Let's work on that. As usual, you can [try it first here](https://cdpn.io/vqRZmy).

```html
<script type="module">
  import { h, text, patch } from "https://unpkg.com/superfine"

  const start = (
    { init, view, update, node },
    state,
    send = (action) => next(update(state, action)),
    next = (newState) => {
      node = patch(node, view((state = newState), send))
    }
  ) => next(init())

  start({
    init: () => 0,
    view: (state, send) =>
      h("main", {}, [
        h("h1", {}, text(state)),
        h("button", { onclick: () => send("DOWN") }, text("-")),
        h("button", { onclick: () => send("UP") }, text("+")),
      ]),
    update: (state, action) =>
      action === "DOWN" ? state - 1 : action === "UP" ? state + 1 : 0,
    node: document.getElementById("app"),
  })
</script>
```

Can you feel the Redux vibes? Exporting `start` from its own specialized module would be a good idea too, but having it all in the same file helps us see the big picture.

## Attributes

Superfine nodes can use any [HTML attributes](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Attributes), [SVG attributes](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/SVG/Attribute), [DOM events](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Events), and [keys](#keys).

### Keys

Keys help identify nodes whenever we update the DOM. By setting the `key` property on a virtual node, you declare that the node should correspond to a particular DOM element. This allows us to re-order the element into its new position, if the position changed, rather than risk destroying it. Keys must be unique among sibling nodes.

> **Warning**: Keys are not registered on the top-level node of your view. If you are toggling the top-level view, and you must use keys, wrap them in an unchanging node.

```js
import { h } from "superfine"

export const ImageGallery = (images) =>
  images.map(({ hash, url, description }) =>
    h("li", { key: hash }, [
      h("img", {
        src: url,
        alt: description,
      }),
    ])
  )
```

## API

### `h(name, props, children)`

Create virtual DOM nodes. `h` takes three arguments: a string that specifies the name of the node; an object of HTML or SVG properties, and array of child nodes (or a string for text nodes).

```js
const link = h("div", { class: "container" }, [
  h("a", { href: "#" }, text("Click Me")),
])
```

### `text(text)`

Create a virtual text node.

```js
const movieTitle = h("h1", {}, text("The Shining"))
```

### `patch(node, vdom)`

Render a virtual DOM. `patch` takes a DOM node, a virtual DOM, and returns the updated DOM node.

```js
const main = patch(
  document.getElementById("main"),
  h("h1", {}, text("Superfine!"))
)
```
